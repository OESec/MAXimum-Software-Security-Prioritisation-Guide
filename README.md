## Understanding the Platform

### Platform Types

The calculator supports multiple platform types, each with tailored security criteria:

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Cloud-based applications
- **Locally Installed**: Applications installed on local devices
- **OAuth**: Applications using OAuth for authorization
- **Plugins**: Browser extensions, IDE plugins, and application add-ons
- **Whitelisting websites**: Requests to whitelist blocked websites and domains


### Scoring System

- **Scores range from 0-100** for each criterion
- **Weighted scoring** ensures important criteria have greater impact
- **Final recommendations**:

- **80-100**: Approve (Green)
- **60-79**: Approve with conditions (Yellow/Orange)
- **0-59**: Reject (Red)





---

## Using the Criteria Reference

### Purpose

The Criteria Reference is your comprehensive guide to understanding all security evaluation criteria across platform types. **Start here** to familiarize yourself with evaluation standards.

### How to Use

1. **Navigate to Criteria Reference** (first tab in navigation)
2. **Select a platform type** using the tabs at the top
3. **Review each criterion**:

1. **Description**: Detailed explanation of what's being evaluated
2. **Weight**: Relative importance in the overall score
3. **Available Options**: All possible choices with scores
4. **Preferred Choice**: Highest-scoring option (marked with â˜…)





### Key Features

- **Color coding**: Green (80-100) = Low risk, Yellow (60-79) = Medium risk, Orange (40-59) = High risk, Red (0-39) = Critical risk
- **Export functionality**: Download criteria as CSV for offline reference
- **Platform comparison**: View statistics across all platform types


### Best Practice

Review the Criteria Reference before performing evaluations to understand scoring rationale and preferred security configurations.

## Performing Security Evaluations

### Step 1: Application Details

1. **Navigate to Calculator**
2. **Select Platform Type**: Choose the appropriate category for your application
3. **Enter Application Information**:

1. **Application Name**: Clear, descriptive name
2. **Description**: Brief explanation of functionality (optional but recommended)
3. **Requestor**: Name of person requesting the application



4. **Click "Continue to Evaluation"**


### Step 2: Security Evaluation

The evaluation interface presents a calculator-style layout with:

#### Application Summary

- Review entered details at the top of the page
- Verify platform type and requestor information


#### Real-time Results Panel

- **Overall Score**: Updates automatically as you make selections
- **Progress bar**: Visual representation of current score
- **Recommendation**: Updates based on current score
- **Detailed Scores**: Shows weighted scores for each completed criterion


#### Security Criteria Calculator

Each criterion appears as a calculator button with:

- **Criterion name and number**
- **Weight percentage**
- **Help icon** (hover for detailed guidance)
- **Description toggle** (expandable explanation)
- **Radio button options** with scores


### Step 3: Making Selections

1. **Work through each criterion systematically**
2. **Use the help tooltips** for guidance on each criterion
3. **Consider the "Internal Alternative Exists?" criterion first** - this appears at the top of all platform types
4. **Watch the real-time score updates** as you make selections
5. **Review detailed scores** to understand the impact of each choice


### Step 4: Completing the Evaluation

- **All criteria must be answered** before getting a final recommendation
- **Export to PDF** once complete for documentation
- **Start New Evaluation** to assess another application

## Understanding Results

### Overall Score Interpretation

- **80-100 (Approve)**: Application meets security requirements
- **60-79 (Approve with conditions)**: Application acceptable with additional controls
- **0-59 (Reject)**: Application does not meet security standards


### Detailed Score Breakdown

Each criterion shows:

- **Selected option** and its raw score (0-100)
- **Weight percentage** of the criterion
- **Weighted points** contributed to total score
- **Progress bar** showing relative contribution


### Recommendation Explanations

- **Approve**: Strong security posture, minimal additional controls needed
- **Approve with conditions**: Acceptable risk with compensating controls
- **Reject**: Unacceptable risk level, recommend alternative solutions


### PDF Export

Generated reports include:

- Application details and evaluation date
- Overall score and recommendation
- Detailed criterion-by-criterion breakdown
- Explanation of recommendation rationale

## Using the Risk Matrix

### Risk Matrix Visualization

The Risk Matrix provides visual analysis of all completed evaluations:

#### Matrix Plot

- **X-axis**: Risk Level (higher = more risk)
- **Y-axis**: Business Impact (higher = more impact)
- **Color coding**: Green (Approved), Orange (Conditional), Red (Rejected)
- **Interactive points**: Hover for detailed information


#### Filtering Options

- **Platform Type**: Filter by specific platform categories
- **Recommendation**: Show only specific recommendation types
- **Time Range**: Adjust date ranges for trend analysis


### Risk Trends Analysis

Switch to the "Risk Trends" tab for:

- **Average security scores over time**
- **Evaluation volume trends**
- **Recommendation distribution patterns**
- **Trend indicators** showing directional changes


### Summary Statistics

- **Total evaluations** by recommendation type
- **Average scores** across time periods
- **Approval rates** and trend analysis

## Administrative Functions

### Platform Type Management

Administrators can:

- **Add new platform types** with custom descriptions
- **Edit existing platform types**
- **Delete unused platform types**


### Criteria Management

For each platform type:

- **Add new security criteria** with descriptions and weights
- **Edit existing criteria** including names, descriptions, and weights
- **Delete outdated criteria**
- **Normalize weights** to ensure they sum to 100%


### Option Management

## Best Practices

### Before Starting Evaluations

1. **Review the Criteria Reference** to understand scoring methodology
2. **Gather application information** including vendor details, functionality, and business justification
3. **Identify the correct platform type** for accurate evaluation


### During Evaluations

1. **Answer "Internal Alternative Exists?" first** - this is prioritized across all platform types
2. **Use help tooltips** for guidance on unfamiliar criteria
3. **Consider business context** when making selections
4. **Review real-time scores** to understand the impact of choices


### After Evaluations

1. **Export PDF reports** for documentation and approval workflows
2. **Review recommendations** with stakeholders
3. **Implement additional controls** for conditional approvals
4. **Monitor approved applications** for ongoing compliance


### For Consistent Results

- **Use the same evaluation approach** across similar applications
- **Document rationale** for scoring decisions
- **Regular training** on criteria interpretation
- **Periodic review** of evaluation outcomes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Cannot export PDF"

- **Cause**: Evaluation not complete
- **Solution**: Ensure all criteria have been answered before exporting


#### "No selection made for criterion"

- **Cause**: Missing answers in evaluation
- **Solution**: Review all criteria and ensure radio button selections are made


#### "Platform type not found"

- **Cause**: Data synchronization issue
- **Solution**: Refresh the page and restart evaluation


#### Scores don't add up to expected total

- **Cause**: Weighted scoring system
- **Solution**: Remember that scores are weighted by criterion importance, not simple averages



### Getting Help

- **Review this guide** for detailed instructions
- **Check the Criteria Reference** for scoring explanations
- **Contact system administrators** for technical issues
- **Refer to organisational security policies** for evaluation guidance
